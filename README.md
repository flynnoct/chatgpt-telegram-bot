# ChatGPT Bot for Telegram

![](/docs/dialog.png)

## üéâ News

- **Continue Chat** is an important function for the bot. No matter how long you've been away, a simple click is all it takes to pick up right where you left off in the conversation. Say goodbye to the frustration of repeating yourself and hello to seamless, uninterrupted dialogue with your bot!
- **No Context Mode**. To better save tokens, we have introduced our "no context mode" which makes each conversation with the ChatGPT a separate session. Opt for this when you have no need for context memory, as it will effectively save you **money**.

## üê± Introduction

ChatGPT Bot for Telegram is implemented with [OpenAI ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) released on March 1, 2023. The Telegram integration framework is based on [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org).

ChatGPT Bot can act as your Telegram contact. You can chat with it personally, share with a contact, and collabrate in a group chat. We attach great importance to privacy protection and make sure the Bot can't acquire any unrelated messages in group chats.

The Bot shares knowledge and inspires exciting new ideas. Many interesting features, such as **DALL¬∑E** and **Whisper** are integrated together to make our Bot smarter and more usable.

We hope you enjoy it!

## üåü Features

The Telegram Bot features the following functions:

- **ChatGPT, the AI consultant**. You can customize the Bot's character according to preference.
- **DALL¬∑E, the Image Generation AI Model**. Send a short prompt to the Bot and get your own painting!
- **Whisper, the Intelligent Speech Recognizer**. The Bot can read your voice messages!
- **Comprehensive privacy protection**. The Bot is unable (and of course we won't) to collect any message in group chat except user prompts.
- **System Role customization** is now supported! Users can customize their own Bot's character and tone!
- **Update the config.json file through command line** is now supported.
- **Logging system** is completed for debug purpose.
- **Telegram Inline Mode (Beta)** is now supported! You can ask @BotFather to enable **both inline mode & inline feedback to 100%** for your Bot and use it in any private chat with a contact and group chat (even without inviting the bot as a member).

Additonal features:

- (Beta) Telegram _inline mode_ is supported to invoke the Bot in a private chat with a contact and a group without bot as a member.
- User Whitelist to control who can use the bot. You can also set `allow_all_users` to `true` to allow all users to use the Bot.
- Set the daily limitation of requirements to **DALL¬∑E**.
- Grant more resources to _Super Users_.
- Docker deployment is supported. (This method is maintained by community. Thanks for @EstrellaXD 's contribution)

## üëã How to Use

The Bot works in both personal and group chat of Telegram.

In a personal chat, simply send a message to the Bot and it will reply to you.

In a group chat, use the `/chat` to invoke the Bot. It will not collect any other message except the prompts after the command.

**(Beta)** In a personal chat with a contact, use `@your_bot_name <your messages>` to invoke the Bot with Telegram inline mode. Both you and your contact can see the Bot's reply in the chat. This function is Beta because it currently can't record the chat context.

### Bot Commands

- `/start`: Start the bot.
- `/role <prompt>`: Set role for conversation.
- `/chat` : Invoke the Bot in group chat.
- `/dalle <prompt>`: Ask DALL¬∑E for a painting based on your prompt.
- `/clear`: Clear the conversation context.
- `/getid`: Get your Telegram user ID.
- `/continue_chat`: Continue your previous conversation even if the session has expired.
- `/toggle_no_context_mode`: toggle between context memory and no context memory. You can specify the mode to switch to, or simply switch to the alternate mode.

## üë∑ Deploy Your Own

### Preparation

1. Create a Telegram bot by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the token.
2. Create an OpenAI account and get the API key.
3. A Linux VM or a server with Python 3 is needed to run the bot.
4. A practical Internet environment is required.
5. (Optional) [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is required for the Bot to handle voice messages with Whisper. If you are not interested in using voice messages, you don't need to install it and **must set `enable_voice` in the config file to False**.

### Installation

1. Git clone from main branch or download the latest release [Source code](https://github.com/flynnoct/chatgpt-telegram-bot/releases/latest) file and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flynnoct/chatgpt-telegram-bot.git
cd chatgpt-telegram-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a config file to manage the Bot.

The config file includes sensitive information, such as telegram_token and openai_api_key, and we only release the corresponding template `config.json.template`. Therefore, you need to create a new `config.json` file by replacing the relative fields in the template with your own. Then, you can use the `config.py` script to udpate the config file through command line.

**Recommended:** You should keep `config.json.template` unmodified because the bot needs to read default configuration values from it. For backward compatibility, it is highly recommended to check the template for newly added parameters when you update to a new version.

```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
cd bin
python config.py
```

In addition, you can follow the [documentation](docs/config_file.md) to manually update your `config.json` file.

3. Run the Bot with `start_bot.sh` and try talk to it. Also, you can invite it to group chats and share with your friends! Or you can also use docker to run the bot.

```bash
# First, make sure you are in the root directory of the project,
# aka <your_download_location>/chatgpt-telegram-bot
bash ./bin/start_bot.sh # start the bot

# Use docker compose to run the bot
docker compose up -d
```

To clear ChatGPT conversation context and restart the Bot, run shell script `restart_bot.sh`. To shut down the Bot, run `stop_bot.sh`.

```bash
bash ./bin/restart_bot.sh # restart the bot
bash ./bin/stop_bot.sh # stop the bot
```
